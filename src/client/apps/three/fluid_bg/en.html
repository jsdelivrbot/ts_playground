            <h2>How to analyse a three.js demo with minified code?</h2>

            <p>First of all, the tools used are the Chrome developer-tools and the
                <a href="http://spector.babylonjs.com/">Spector.js</a> WebGL debugger. The first thing I always do is grabbing a frame with Spector and have a look
                at the drawcalls being run. This will also tell me (via the stacktraces in Spector) which rendering-library
                was used (three.js for instance can be spotted easily just by looking at the function-names).</p>

            <p>Now that I know it was done in three.js I will use the devtools to find the JS-file containg three.js. Useful
                here are searches for strings we will find in three.js, like "MeshStandardMaterial" (present as string-value
                in
                <tt>MeshStandardMaterial.type</tt> so the chances are high that uglify etc. will not have touched it). Once found,
                we can auto-format the likely minified file to start digging.</p>

            <p>The next step is to locate the render-function. Depending on the minifier used that can be tricky, but most minifiers
                will not mangle the names of public properties and methods. A good choice here is to search for ".isCamera",
                which appears exactly twice in the current version of three.js: once in the definition of the canera baseclass
                and once as the very first statement of the
                <tt>renderer.render()</tt>-function.</p>
            <p>We found the render-function and can now just drop a breakpoint in its first line. Assuming the three.js animation
                is running, the debugger will stop almost immediately. Knowing that the first parameter of the render-call
                is the scene, we can now start exploring by looking at
                <tt>scene.children</tt>, using
                <tt>scene.traverse</tt> and so on, all just by issuing commands via the console with the debugger paused. To
                further analyse what exactly is happening, you can do anything: change material colors, enable wireframe-rendering,
                export geometries using
                <tt>.toJSON()</tt> or inspect custom shaders used by looking at
                <tt>obj.material.vertexShader</tt> and
                <tt>obj.material.fragmentShader</tt>.</p>

            <p>From all of this, I was able to piece together the code you will find in the JS-Tab of this pen, which exactly
                reproduces the effect used in the background of the analysed page. Success!</p>
